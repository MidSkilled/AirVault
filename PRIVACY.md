# AirVault Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-01-09

This Privacy Policy explains what information the AirVault Discord Bot ("AirVault", "the Bot") collects, why it collects it, and how that data is used.

1. Data collected
- Server configuration: settings such as currency name, symbol, daily/weekly amounts, shop items, and selected channels/roles are stored so the Bot can operate.
- User economy data: user balances, inventory items, and transaction history are stored to support the in-server economy features.
- Minimal runtime metadata: discord user IDs and server IDs (guild IDs) are used as keys; usernames or other profile fields may be read via Discord at runtime when constructing messages or embers.

2. How data is used
- The Bot uses data to provide core features: track balances, enforce cooldowns, present leaderboards, and handle shop purchases.
- Data is not sold or shared with third parties for marketing.

3. Data retention and deletion
- Data is retained while the Bot is active in a server. Server admins may request deletion of a server's data by removing the Bot and contacting the owner. The owner will remove stored data on request where feasible.

4. Security
- The Bot owner uses reasonable administrative and technical safeguards but cannot guarantee absolute security. Do not use the Bot to store sensitive personal information.

5. Third-party services
- The Bot may use third-party services (e.g., Giphy API). These services may receive limited request data (for example, the terms of a GIF search request). Please consult those services' privacy policies for details.

6. Children's privacy
- The Bot is not intended for children under the age required by law in your jurisdiction. If you believe data for a child has been collected, contact the Bot owner to request removal.

7. Changes to this Policy
- The Bot owner may update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.

8. Contact
- For any inquiry, contact the Bot owner via Email: quinxsky@gmail.com
